These are the projects I completed in my Astronomy research python course. I created detailed plots and images using raw data from the Hubble Space 
Telescope. Each project focused on data analysis, data visualization, and image analysis techniques common to astronomy. Specifically, they are:

Advanced-Image-Ananlysis
<ul>
  <li>Image Cutouts</li>
  <li>Visualization of Markers on Images</li>
  <li>MSegmentation Mapss</li>
  <li>Quantitative Analysis of Image Data</li>
</ul>

Astronomy-Image-Analysis
<ul>
  <li>Use the Python astropy package to analize, view, and convolve images</li>
</ul>

Professional-Plotting-with-Python: Advanced Plotting with MatplotLib
<ul>
  <li>AXIS-specific plotting</li>
  <li>Twin axis plotting</li>
  <li>Multiple Panel Plotting</li>
  <li>2D Histogram Plot</li>
  <li>Contour Plotting with 2-D Histograms</li>
  <li>Professionalism in Plotting</li>
</ul>

If you are interested in seeing the results of my code and my descriptions of my results, please see the .PDF in each folder.
